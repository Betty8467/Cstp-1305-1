/*
Question 4 (HARD): Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum. A path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path sum is the sum of the node values along the path. 

 

Example: 

Input: root = -10 

Output: 25 

Explanation: The optimal path is -10, 20, 15 with a sum of 25.
